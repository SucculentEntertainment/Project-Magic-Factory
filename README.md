## Contributing
You will not be able to contribute directly to this project by submitting code or changing other files, but as soon as we get to a state of the game where playtesting will make sense, you will be able to playtest and give us feedback.

## How to get
Unfortunately, the game is in a Pre-Alpha state of development und thus is far from being finished. As soon as it is ready for releasing, you can get the game on [our itch.io page](https://succulent-entertainment.itch.io/). There will be no prebuilt downloads here on GitHub, but if you know how to build the game, feel free to clone this repo and build it yourself.
